Usage:
This app keeps track of pools and allows you to store information about them. To view a pool click on a pool from the list and view its metadata or click on a button to see more data.
You can add a pool by clicking the plus button in the top right hand corner of the screen. Once you have viewed a pool you can swipe left or right to view others or you can hit the back button.
Each pool has tasks (not implemented yet), history (not implemented yet), a shopping list, and and issues button in which you can get more information on the pool. 

*Note* When you add a pool it gets stored on a cloud database. So if you see other pools that you didn't create they may be from other users.

Bugs: When adding an issue to the database it will cause an error. The app doesn't crash, but it is a backend error we have to fix.

Not Yet Implemented:
Tasks Button, will show tasks that the pool technican will have to do.

History Button, will show a maintenance history of the pool.

Location, the pool list will be filtered by location so that you only select pools that are near you. 

Notifications, will alert you when a task needs to be done or if there is a new item you need to buy on the shopping list
